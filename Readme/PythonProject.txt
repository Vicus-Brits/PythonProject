Your mission, should you wish to accept: 

IN NO SPECIFIC ORDER: 

Create an API accoount at https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/signup  in order to get temperaturesbased on GEO locations
	Call that API (JSON or XML), (both at some point..) and get the current temperature in celcius and fharenheit.

Create a web front end where you can select Johannesburg or Pretoria and pass the GEO location to the weather API
	Info:  Geo locations
	Johannesburg 	-26.2041,28.0473
	Pretoria 	-25.7313,28.2184
	The Geo location must be read from a CSV file. 
Get the temperature from the API, store it in a SQLite database, read it from the SQLite database and return the values to the front end. 

Build a function in Python to convert celcius to fahrenheit.
Call your function with the Celcius from weatherunlocked and check if their fahrenheit calculation is correct, return the result of the check to the front end.

Create your own API using Python to convert celcius to fahrenheit.
Call your API with the Celcius from weatherunlocked and check if their fahrenheit calculation is correct, return the result of the check to the front end.

Implement some form of access control to your application using Auth 0 /Zero 

Get you website pretty, use this https://tutorialzine.com/2015/07/freebie-7-clean-and-responsive-forms
